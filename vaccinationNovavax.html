        <hr />
        <p>
            A subunit COVID-19 vaccine produced by Novavax and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is marketed under the brand names Nuvaxovid and Covovax,
            among others (CEPI).

        <hr />
        <h4><b>Year 2020</b></h4>
        <p>
            The development of a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, code-named NVX-CoV2373, was disclosed by Novavax in January 2020. The work of Novavax is up against the
            efforts of numerous other businesses for the creation of vaccines.
        </p>
        <p>
            For preclinical and early-stage human research on the vaccine candidate, Emergent BioSolutions and Novavax announced their partnership in March 2020. As part of the
            partnership, Emergent BioSolutions was tasked with producing the vaccine in large quantities at their facility in Baltimore. However, Novavax later teamed with a
            different manufacturer in a new deal supervised by the U.S. government in order to reduce the pressure on the plant after production problems with the Johnson &
            Johnson and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines at its Baltimore plant.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2021</b></h4>
        <p>
            The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) underwent a rolling review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) beginning in February 2021. The EMA received a request
            for conditional marketing authorization in November 2021. Following a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Commission granted a conditional
            marketing authorization for it to be sold under the brand name Nuvaxovid throughout the EU on December 20, 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was approved for use in November 2021 in Indonesia, the Philippines, December in India, January in South Korea, Australia, February in the United Kingdom, Canada, Taiwan,
            and Singapore. The World Health Organization certified it as valid as of December 2021.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2022</b></h4>
        <p>
            The FDA approved NVX-CoV2373 for emergency use as a primary immunization (not a booster) in adults on July 13, 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            The FDA authorized the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine for use in people 12 to 17 years old on August 19, 2022. The CDC advised teenagers aged 12 to 17 to have the Novavax COVID-19
            vaccine on August 22, 2022.

        <hr />
        <p>
            The most frequent side effects are fatigue, feeling ill, headache, nausea, tenderness and pain at the injection site, fever, and pain in the muscles and joints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction), paresthesia (an odd sensation in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling sensation), hypoesthesia (a decrease in feeling
            or sensitivity, especially in the skin), and pericarditis are other potential adverse effects (inflammation of lining around the heart).
