        <hr />
        <p>
            The American company Moderna, the American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
            Authority produced the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, which is marketed under the trade name Spikevax (BARDA). It is approved for use in people six months of age
            or older, twelve years of age, or eighteen years of age or older, depending on the jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            It offers defense against COVID-19, a virus infection brought on by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is intended to be given intramuscularly in two or three doses of
            0.5 ml each, spaced at least 28 days apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is an mRNA vaccine made of lipid nanoparticle-coated nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA), which encodes the SARAS-CoV-2 spike protein. In many nations, it has
            some kind of authorization for use.

        <hr />
        <h4><b>Year 2020</b></h4>
        <p>
            Moderna announced the creation of an RNA vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, to generate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was being considered by a number of nations as of December 2020 for emergency authorization or approval, which would allow for
            a quick rollout of the vaccine in the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), Canada, and the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020, for those who are
            18 years of age or older. The FDA has given its approval to this Moderna product, the company's first. The EUA was extended to include individuals from birth to the
            age of sixteen in June 2022.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2021</b></h4>
        <p>
            In the year 2021, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was authorised for emergency use in various countries including the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and Japan.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2022</b></h4>
        <p>
            Bivalent vaccines containing elasomeran/elasomeran 0-omicron (Spikevax Bivalent Zero/Omicron) were authorized for use as booster doses in people 18 years of age
            and older in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United States in August and September 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant is the basis for the second component of the bivalent vaccine version used in the United States (mRNA-1273.222), whereas Omicron BA.1 variant is the
            basis for the second component of the bivalent vaccine version used in other countries (mRNA-1273.214).

        <hr />
        <p>
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the vaccine's adverse event (AE) profile "did not suggest any specific safety concerns" and that "the safety data supported a
            favorable safety profile." The most frequent side effects were arthralgia, myalgia (muscle pain), lethargy, headaches, and pain at the injection site (joint pain).
        </p>
        <p>
            The US CDC confirmed in June 2021 that 13 out of every million young people, mostly male and older than 16, who received the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine develop myocarditis
            or pericarditis. Most affected people bounce back fast with the right care and rest. The vaccinated limb may experience significant swelling as additional side effects.
