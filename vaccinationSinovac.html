        <hr />
        <p>
            The Chinese company Sinovac Biotech created CoronaVac, also referred to as the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, which is an entire inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. It is based on
            conventional technology similar to other inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccines including the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, another Chinese vaccine, and Covaxin, an Indian vaccine,
            and was phase III clinically tested in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey. CoronaVac does not require freezing; instead, it can be transported refrigerated
            at temperatures between 2 and 8 °C (36 and 46 °F), the same range at which flu vaccines are stored.

        <hr />
        <h4><b>Year 2020</b></h4>
        <p>China authorized the use of CoronaVac for high-risk groups like medical staff in late August 2020.</p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2021</b></h4>
        <p>
            Numerous nations in Asia, South America, Central America, and Eastern Europe employ CoronaVac in vaccine efforts. Sinovac had a 2 billion dosage annual production capacity as
            of April 2021. Several factories in China are currently producing it, and Brazil will start exporting it in September 2021, followed by Egypt and Hungary.
        </p>
        <p>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) certified the vaccine for use in an emergency on June 1, 2021. Sinovac and COVAX have agreements in place for the acquisition of 380
            million doses. With 943 million doses administered as of July 2021, CoronaVac was the COVID-19 vaccine that was most frequently used worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            CoronaVac has received the most doses of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide as of October 14, 2021.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2022</b></h4>
        <p>
            A Hong Kong research published in October 2022 discovered that two CoronaVac doses only provided 64% to 75% protection for older persons. However, an additional booster or
            third CoronaVac treatment was able to increase the degree of COVID-19 protection to nearly 98%.

        <h2 style="font-family: 'Hind Guntur', sans-serif; color: #2e4450;"><b>Adverse Effects</b></h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Injection-site pain (13-21%, depending on the dosing schedule) was the side effect that was reported the most frequently within 28 days of the second dose, according the data. It is typical
            for other COVID-19 vaccines to cause injection site reactions. Diarrhoea, tiredness, and muscle soreness were some additional side effects. Most of these adverse effects were
            minor and only persisted for two days.
        </p>
        <p>The research also mentions that people who got CoronaVac experienced less fever than those who received other COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Moderna mRNA-based vaccination.</p>
