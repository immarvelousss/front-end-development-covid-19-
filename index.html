        <!-- DESCRIPTION (JEYVIAN) -->
        <p>
            A virus called SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), was found to be first active in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has quickly spread around the globe and is very contagious.
            Respiratory symptoms with COVID-19 are most frequently present and can resemble those of the flu, the cold, or pneumonia. Besides your lungs and respiratory system, COVID-19 may also harm other organs.
            The illness may also affect different areas of your body.
        </p>

                        and spread to the rest of the world. The Alpha varient later faded with

                        an increase in severity from Gamma but some monoclonal antibody treatments
                        may be less effective against Gamma.

                        On top of countries lifting public health measures, there has been a huge increase
                        in cases and a huge surge in hospitalisation.

                                    There is also a round of medical screening conducted on-site on the day of vaccination.
                                    Persons who remain unsure after clearing the online screening form,
                                    or who choose to walk-in to a vaccination site without going through online screening will also be screened on-site.

                                        Internationally, a large number of pregnant and breastfeeding women have received a COVID-19 vaccination.
                                        The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has examined studies done to monitor women who were
                                        vaccinated when they were pregnant, and their babies. These studies were done on women at different trimesters of
                                        pregnancy and there is no evidence to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty or Moderna/Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine
                                        may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies.

                                    <p>
                                        Both Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty and Moderna/Spikevax COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines.
                                        As mRNA vaccines are not live vaccines, they are biologically unlikely to adversely affect breastfed babies.
                                        In addition, the breast milk of vaccinated mothers may help to protect their babies from COVID-19 due to
                                        antibodies in breast milk. There have also been no vaccine-related side effects reported in the babies
                                        who were breastfed by mothers who received the vaccine while breastfeeding.

                                        There is currently limited data in pregnant women. Nevertheless, The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccines
                                        is an inactivated vaccine, while Novavax/Nuvaxovid is a protein subunit vaccine.
                                        These vaccines are routinely used in many other vaccines with a documented good safety profile,
                                        including in pregnant women.
