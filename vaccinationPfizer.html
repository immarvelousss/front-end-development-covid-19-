        <hr />
        <p>
            The German biotechnology company BioNTech created the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which is marketed as Comirnaty and is based on mRNA. To develop it,
            BioNTech worked with the American company Pfizer to handle manufacturing, shipping, and clinical testing. It is permitted to be used to protect against COVID-19,
            a disease brought on by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in people five years of age and older in some jurisdictions, in people twelve years of age and older in some jurisdictions,
            and in people sixteen years of age and older in other jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vaccine is administered intramuscularly. It is made up of lipid nanoparticle-encased nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) that codes for a mutant version of the full-length spike
            protein of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, it was recommended that immunization be administered in two doses, 21 days apart, but in the US and Canada, the time interval was later increased
            to 42 days and up to four months.

        <hr />
        <h4><b>Year 2020</b></h4>
        <p>
            The vaccine is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for both routine usage and emergency use by a strict regulatory body. The United Kingdom was the first nation to authorize
            its usage in an emergency situation in December 2020. Most nations have some level of authorization for its use.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2021</b></h4>
        <p>
            The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval for use in people aged sixteen and over in the United States on
            August 23, 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            The business had sold more than 1.5 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as of September 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech planned to produce roughly 2.5 billion doses in 2021 as of
            March 30th, 2021. Logistics are difficult since the vaccine must be kept at very low temperatures for distribution and storage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Year 2022</b></h4>
        <p>
            A bivalent variant of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Bivalent) was approved for use in the United States in August 2022 as a booster dose for those aged
            twelve and older. The BA.1 form of the bivalent vaccination, also known as tozinameran/riltozinameran or Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1, was approved for use as a booster in
            the UK in September 2022 for those ages twelve and older. The bivalent vaccine's BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 (tozinameran/famtozinameran) booster formulations were both approved by the
            European Union for use in people 12 years of age and older within the same month.

        <hr />
        <p>
            The majority of COVID-19 vaccination side effects are low to moderate in severity and go away within a few days. They resemble other adult vaccinations and are typical
            indications that the body is developing viral defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            In clinical studies, the most frequent side effects were discomfort and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pains, chills, joint pain, and fever,
            which affected more than 1 in 10 people.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Allergy</b></h4>
        <p>
            The COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine has documented hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is a relatively uncommon allergy. On average, eleven incidents of severe
            adverse reaction have been reported per million doses of administered vaccination. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 71% of those allergic reactions
            occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination, and that persons with a history of allergies or allergic reactions were most likely to experience them (81%) than other people.
        </p>
        <p>
            On December 9, 2020, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a recommendation cautioning against administering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
            vaccination to anyone who have a history of "severe" allergic reaction.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4><b>Myocarditis</b></h4>
        <p>
            A possible link between the second dose and myocarditis in a limited sample of men between the ages of 16 and 30 was reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health in June 2021.
            For every million vaccine recipients between December 2020 and May 2021, there were 55 occurrences of myocarditis; 95% of these cases were mild, and the majority of patients were
            hospitalized for no longer than four days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since April 2021, more incidences of myocarditis and pericarditis—mostly in males over the age of 16—have been documented in the United States in around 13 per 1 million young
            individuals who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine. Most affected people bounce back fast with the right care and rest.
